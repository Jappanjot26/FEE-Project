      <p class="lines">
        Bhagat Singh became politically active at a very young age, and he
        founded the Naujawan Bharat Sabha in 1926 along with other like-minded
        youth leaders. The organization aimed to bring together young people who
        were disillusioned with the Indian National Congress and were looking
        for more radical ways to fight for India's freedom.

      <div class="lines" style="text-align: justify;margin-left:20px">
        Bhagat Singh was an active participant in the Non-Cooperation Movement
         launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920. However, he became disillusioned
        with the movement's non-violent methods and started advocating for more
        aggressive and direct action to overthrow British colonial rule.

      <h3 class="sec-head">Bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly</h3>
      <p class="lines">
        In 1928, Bhagat Singh and his fellow revolutionaries bombed the Central
        Legislative Assembly in Delhi as a protest against the Public Safety
        Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill. The bombing was meant to send a
        message to the British government that they were no longer going to
        tolerate the injustices of colonial rule.
      </p>
    </div>
      <h3 class="sec-head">Hunger Strike in Jail</h3>
      <p class="lines">
        After the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly, Bhagat Singh and
        his colleagues were arrested and imprisoned. In jail, they went on a
        hunger strike to protest against the inhumane treatment of political
        prisoners. The hunger strike lasted for 116 days, and it drew
        international attention to the Indian independence movement.

      <h3 class="sec-head">Assassination of British Police Officer</h3>
      <p class="lines">
        In 1928, Bhagat Singh and his associates also assassinated a British
        police officer named John Saunders in Lahore. The assassination was a
        retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent Indian
        nationalist leader who died after being beaten by the police during a
        protest.
      </p>
      <h3 class="sec-head">Trial and Execution</h3>
      <p class="lines">
        Bhagat Singh and his associates were put on trial for their
        revolutionary activities, and they used the court proceedings as an
        opportunity to bring attention to the injustices of British colonial
        rule. Despite their efforts, they were found guilty and sentenced to
        death. Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were executed on March 23,
        1931.
