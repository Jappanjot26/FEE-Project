        Bhagat Singh was just 23 years old when he was executed by the British on 23rd March 1931. He was hanged along with his comrades, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar, in the Lahore Central Jail. The execution was a result of their revolutionary activities and the assassination of a British police officer named John Saunders.
